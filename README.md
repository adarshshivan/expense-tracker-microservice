# Expense Tracker Microservice

This project is a serverless expense tracking application built using AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and API Gateway, with a lightweight frontend deployed on Vercel. It supports full CRUD operations for managing expenses and automatically switches between two modes:

1. **Live AWS Mode** – Uses real API endpoints and updates DynamoDB.

2. **Demo Mode** – Works fully offline using predefined sample data, ideal for portfolio demos after AWS resources are deleted.

The system demonstrates practical cloud engineering skills, including serverless backend development, REST API integration, CORS handling, DynamoDB operations, and frontend–backend communication.
